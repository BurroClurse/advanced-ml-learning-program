# Learning Principles  

This repository serves as a self‑paced learning program based on the Coursera Advanced Machine Learning specialization. It is structured to be accessible to beginners while providing a clear path toward more advanced topics.  

**Key rules:**  
- **Vernacular control:** Every new term is defined in plain English when first introduced.  
- **Three‑layer explanations:** Concepts are explained from intuition to mechanics to code. First, what the idea means; second, how it works (light math if needed); third, how to implement it.  
- **Learning vs. portfolio code:** Code used for learning can be exploratory and messy. Code intended for portfolio projects is clean, documented, and professional.  
- **Glossary and checkpoints:** A running glossary records definitions in simple terms. Checkpoints help verify that you can explain concepts without jargon.
