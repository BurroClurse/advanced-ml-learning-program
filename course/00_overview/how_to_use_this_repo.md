# How to Use This Repository  

This repository is divided into two main areas: the `course` folder for your learning materials and tasks, and the `projects` folder for polished portfolio projects.  

**Getting started:**  
- Navigate to `course/00_overview` to read about the learning principles and to understand the plain‑English description of Project 1.  
- Use the `course/glossary.md` for definitions of terms.  
- Follow the tasks in `course/module_01_tasks` to begin working on the first project.  

**Workflow tips:**  
- Work through tasks incrementally. Each task will introduce only a few new terms.  
- When you encounter a new term or concept, check the glossary or the learning notes.  
- Keep your exploratory notebooks and scripts inside the `course` directories.  
- When you're ready to create a polished project artifact, place your code, results, and documentation in the `projects` folder under an appropriate subfolder.  

This structure ensures you can learn and experiment freely while keeping your portfolio clean and professional.
