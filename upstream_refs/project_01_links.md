# Project 1: Upstream References  

This document provides links to the relevant folders in the original Coursera **Advanced Machine Learning** repository that support Project 1 (tabular healthcare machine learning). These links allow you to explore the original course materials without copying them into this repository.  

## How to Win a Data Science Competition (Module 2)  

This module covers feature engineering, validation strategies, and model evaluation for tabular datasets. It is the primary resource for Project 1. Browse the files in the Coursera repository here: [2 - How to Win a Data Science Competition](https://github.com/SJD1882/MOOC-Coursera-Advanced-Machine-Learning/tree/master/2%20-%20How%20to%20Win%20a%20Data%20Science%20Competition).  

## Shared materials on optimization and regularization  

Within the Introduction to Deep Learning course there are shared notes on optimization algorithms and regularization techniques. These concepts are useful for understanding training dynamics in Project 1, even though they come from the deep learning module. You can find these materials here: [1 - Introduction to Deep Learning (shared materials)](https://github.com/SJD1882/MOOC-Coursera-Advanced-Machine-Learning/tree/master/1%20-%20Introduction%20to%20Deep%20Learning).  

### How to use these links
